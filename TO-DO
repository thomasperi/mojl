Add the option to automagically copy assets to a subdirectory inside build, so that the modules directory can be outside docroot. Maybe allow a pattern to be assigned for deciding whether to copy each file.

Add a templating feature, where modules can `include` one another and you can build a whole site with it.

Add the option to set a pattern or function to determine whether to timestamp a given file during path rewriting.

Add “superset” feature to node mojl for merging css and scss into the same file

Allow modules in nested folders, for namespacing purposes

Allow mojl modules to be npm packages (thereby being able to require other mojls), by checking for the presence of a `mojl.json` file. If present, read it to determine the path of the subdirectory that includes the module's files instead of the module's root directory. Should default to the same name as the endpoint.

Discourage distributing them using composer and other package managers. Every mojl will be built with node-mojl, but only some mojls are for use with PHP, WP, or whatever else.

Allow combining modules from multiple parent directories in the same build, so that composer and npm mojls can be used alongside each other.




PHP MOJL:

Feature for reading a module’s output into a string instead of echoing.

Feature to read and cache mojl.json for each module, to determine where to find its files.


WP MOJL:
